Homework 3 for CSI 4180 (Pre-trained Transformer-based Models)

**Files:**

Report for Homework3.pdf: Required file for submission of the assignment. Not needed for running the program.

Section2_3.ipynb: This file contains all of my code for section 2.3 of the assignment. It was created using Google Colab

homeworkThree.py: This file contains all of my code for sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4 of the assignment. Instructions to run it can be found below

**Instructions for running homeworkThree.py:**

I have provided a sample command that can be used to run this program below

Example Command:

python3 homeworkThree.py

Note: No command line arguments will be accepted. Also, you must have the following packages installed: datasets, nltk, transformers, numpy, and scikit-learn. Additionally, this file will run very slow when loading and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

**Instructions for running Section2_3.ipynb:**

Click on the link to open the file in Google Colab, then sign in with your Google account. Once signed in, you can run the code by hitting the play button on each section. Hit the play buttons one at a time, starting from the top of the file.

**Credit to AI:**

I utilized GitHub Copilot to assist me. In homeworkThree.py, there is a comment that gives credit to AI. I used this tool to predict the labels for the test split and then print the accuracy after fine-tuning a pre-trained model.
